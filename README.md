# MOS6581-PCB
KiCad PCB layout for MOS6581

This board hosts a _Commodore / MOS Technology **MOS6581** sound synthesis IC_ (see datasheet below). It provides 5 VDC and 12 VDC power supplies from a single 12 VDC input. It also contains an on-board 1 MHz oscillator, as required by the MOS6581. Additionally, it breaks out all of the required outside signals to run an MOS6581 (5 address bits, 8 data bits, assorted other signals) to a 20-pin header connector for external control (microcontroller, etc).
